It is very feature complete and allows basic scripting for complementing more complex page logic.
It supports Combats, Test your Luck (or any other skill), items, quantities of items, images on pages, etc.
The only drawback it that you have to have Java RE installed, but it's just a download 64MB and a next/next/finish install.
